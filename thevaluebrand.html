                        Branding is what helps a prospective buyer call to mind a particular company when it comes time to buy. Branding also helps with  awareness .

                    <p>
                        In a world of infinite choices, branding that helps people remember your company is more important than ever. Today consumers have a seemingly endless choice of retailers, products and services available at their fingertips online, or at the local strip shopping centers or shopping malls.
                        If consumers are shopping for something, what do they do? &nbsp;Go to Google, where billions of Web pages and yellow page listings are available.
                    </p>
                    <p>Not only are there many choices, but some of the decision factors that traditionally separated and defined companies are today transparent and without much difference. &nbsp;Take, for example, pricing. &nbsp;Pricing is easier to discover and compare than ever before. &nbsp;In certain industries there may be very little price difference.</p>
                    <p>When all prices are the same, what makes the buyer choose one over another? &nbsp;Nuances and qualitative factors may make the difference.

                    </p>
                    
                   
                    <p>For small businesses, what sets apart the business may be factors such as high quality, craftsmanship, personalized customer service, superior knowledge to help customers make the proper product selections, and similar qualitative factors.</p>
                    <p>The challenge for some small businesses is how to get customers to think of them when it’s time to buy. &nbsp;You don’t want your company to be nonexistent in the customer’s mind.</p>
                    <p>And if they see your brand name in a list of competing vendors (such as in a search engine), you want your brand to be associated with positive factors that make it stand out.</p>
                    <p>Branding is not a replacement for sales or specific marketing campaigns. &nbsp;But branding assists and reinforces your sales and marketing efforts in important ways.</p>

                                    <h3>Branding improves recognition </h3>
                                    One of the major components of a brand is a logo because, as the “face” of a business, it’s what people instantly recognize. A professional logo design is simple enough to be memorable, but powerful enough to give the desired impression of your company

                                Just as people are more likely to purchase from a business that appears polished and legitimate, families need to feel comfortable before committing to a child care program. a good brand creates trust and can easily identify the business as a trusted

                                <h3> Branding supports advertising</h3>
                                Since a brand creates trust, a trusted brand suports and cuts cost in advertising. good branding can also help a business get word-of-mouth referrals. The most profitable companies, small and large, have a single thing in common. They have established themselves as a leader in their particular industry by building a strong brand
