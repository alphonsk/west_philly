                <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
                <br> 
                <p>
                        Software engineering is the study of and practice of how to build, design, develop, maintain, and retire software. In today’s world software is everywhere, and used on everything from common examples like a cellphone to uncommon items such as a microwave or coffee makers. This equipment and others use software programs to make our life’s easier and better
                        In college students study the fundamentals of computing by learning about computers, how they work by taking introductory classes in computer science, in higher college levels students learn to design and make simple programs.
                        
                </p>

                <h1>Why should you be a software engineer?  </h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                        For a few good reasons, money being one and available opportunities. Our country’s long dependency on factory manual labor has shifted to engineering jobs. The only new wave of jobs now and in the future will require well trained professionals to build, design, and develop new programs to solve our problems
                </p>

                <br>
                <h1> What They Do </h1>
                <p>
                        Software engineers design, build, launch and maintain software products.  A software is a solution to a problem, examples include   operating systems, business applications, mobile and web applications, games, connected hardware devices, networking systems and more. A problem does not need to be bad, however it helps to have an automated way to solve it, as simple example is a calculator, we all can do simple math, but a calculator simplifies that task to a few minutes’ task
                    </p><p>
                        Software Engineers are problem solvers, they identify a problem and find new ideas to solve those problems 
                        
                </p>

 

                <br>
                <h3> Education Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                        There is no required or standard education required for software engineers. As in all jobs, formal education has always been the standard but as technology advances and the need for engineers grow, unformal training is bridging the gap. Online educators and trade school style learning institutions are offering cheap training and train as you go style training.
                        Several of the large software companies, such as Microsoft, Google, Oracle and Red Hat offer certifications for some engineering roles without requiring any educational background 
                        
                </p>
                <p>  
                        Having said that, software engineers are expected to have working level knowledge in various areas such as data structures, algorithms, design patterns, computer graphics, and web development. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Money and Outlook </h3>
                <p>
                        Software engineering pay varies in part because of the many roles they play. Among other variables that influence pay are companies, locations and experience. In general, like all other jobs entry level engineers make the least, the average entry level pay according to the ubl.org is $60,000. However specialization and demand changes that, highly sort after security experts with no formal training and no enterprise job experience make a lot more, so do high income generating startups engineers
