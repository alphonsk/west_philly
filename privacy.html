        <p>
            Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive.
            </p><p>
            Like many sites, we use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Site.
        </p>
        <p>
                We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.  This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.
</p><p>
                We also use third party advertisements to support our site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

        </p>
        <p>
                You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.  This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
            </p><p>
                Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program.  Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
        </p>
        <p>
                Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.
                Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
                Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous?sig=ACi0TCiVWlAUbzHVsoNJfeXCWFN6BPITUeOhEsqgelKI6XSn7VQn51RwEbFDllp1ETbrFgyD1f1_A6mT27sejCQ0bmgFSfTxD1IIPFJ9KyXqu6vu5chg5Z0&hl=en">Ads Settings</a>.
