                    <p>
                            Vision, mission and values are key elements of an organization’s strategic planning.  They must be
                            approved by the board of directors and should be communicated to staff, volunteers, members and
                            other stakeholders.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h3> Vision </h3>
                    <p>
                        The vision sets out what the organization wants to accomplish, and should inspire members, staff and
                            supporters.    Vision statements may describe:
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                            how things would be different as a result of the organization’s activities  
                            ‐eg. Canadian Cancer Society:  Creating a world where no Canadian fears cancer
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                how the organization wants to be seen by others ‐eg. Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants: We are Canada’s most valued, internationally
                                                         recognized profession of leaders in senior management, advisory, financial, tax and assurance roles

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            
                            Good visions are aspirational. Some are hard‐to‐reach ideals while others are more modest or describe
                            objectives that are achievable in the near future. In either case, the vision helps establish the unique
                            contribution that the organization makes to society.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                            From a practical perspective a vision can be a quick, memorable way to describe the organization’s
                            reason for being. This can be valuable in times of crisis when it helps to remember what is really
                            important. The vision and mission are often published in the organization’s annual reports, brochures
                            and fund‐raising materials.
                        </p> 

                        <br>
                        <h3> Mission </h3>
                        <p>
                                The mission typically describes what the organization does to achieve its vision. Because the vision is
                                often expressed as a dream or ideal, the mission helps clarify the practical aspects of what the
                                organization will actually do. Most missions emphasize action, using such words as: support, involve,
                                assist, contribute, provide, promote, etc.
                                <li> ‐eg. United Way of Toronto mission: To meet urgent human needs and improve social conditions
                                by mobilizing the community’s volunteer and financial resources in a common cause of caring </li> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The organization’s mission must be compatible with its legal purposes and must meet the requirements
                                for not‐for‐profit and (if applicable) charitable status.  A good mission statement is concise and precise.   
                                It should identify the organization’s key stakeholders and set out how the organization will serve them.
                                <li>  ‐eg. CNIB (Canadian National Institute for the Blind) mission:  To enhance independence for
                                people with vision loss and to be the leader in promoting vision health</li>
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h3> Values </h3>
                        <p>
                                Shared values influence everything an organization does, as well as its relationships with stakeholders
                                and its reputation.   Values may be expressed as beliefs, guidelines or rules, and may be set out in a code
                                of conduct.   
                                <br>
                                Eg. Canadian Red Cross Values: <br>
                                Integrity and accountability <br>
                                Ethical practices <br>
                                Quality <br>
                                Caring and compassion <br>
                                Client‐focused <br>
                                Responsiveness
                                <br>
                        <p> 
                         A statement of values can provide guidance when tough decisions must be made, for example in
                                allocating scarce resources, or when presented
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The values, mission and vision are key elements of a not‐for‐profit organization’s strategic planning
                                process, and will guide the development and delivery of program services and activities.  
                        </p>
